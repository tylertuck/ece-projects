# Tyler Tucker's Electrical/Computer Engineering Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I've completed as part of my Electrical Engineering coursework at the University of Florida. These include work in digital systems design, embedded systems, circuit design, and C++ programming.

### Digital Logic & FPGA (Quartus Projects)
These projects were built using Quartus and VHDL and utilized the DE10-Lite for testing.

- **Elementary CPU Design**  
  Used an RALU and ROM to carry out certain instructions.

- **Traffic Light Controller**  
  State Machine based controller using DE10-Lite board.

- **Seven Segment Decoder**  
  Converts 4-bit binary to 7-segment display signals.

### AVR Assembly (ATxmega128A1U)
Low-level embedded systems labs using AVR assembly language in microchip studio.

- **External Bus Interface**  
  Conditional averages, branching, memory writes

- **LED Animation Controller**  
  Software debounce, SRAM storage, DIP switch control

### Circuit Design Projects
Hands-on analog circuit work involving audio amplification, filter design, and simulation.

- **Audio Amplifier Design**  
  Circuit simulated using Multisim and physically built

- **RC Low-Pass Filter**  
  Frequency response testing and Bode plot analysis

###  C++ Programming Projects
Object-oriented programming projects created for COP 2274 (C++ for Engineers).

- **Basic Operations Calculator**  
  Class based functions and object oriented programming

- **Grade Calculator**  
  Uses input parsing, control flow, and arrays
